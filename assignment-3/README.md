Server.js

Script that configures a HTTP server that listens to incoming client connections.
Clients are expected to send chat-like messages (see index.html) which are replied
to depending if certain patterns are recognised in the message (or not). The idea
is to create a simple artificial conversation between the a human subject and the
script. The work is inspired by Alan Turing's Imitation Game and Joseph Weizenbaum's
ELIZA.
